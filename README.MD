# Terminus Island calculator

<p>
This is an app developed in React Native using Expo Framework with the only porpuse to solve the puzzle in Terminus Island on Call of Duty Black Ops 6 zombies
to get the Beam Smasher.
</p>

<p>
    You only need to press the symbols that correspond to X, Y and Z and the final result will be displayed down below.
</p>

## Future improvements
 - Better quality symbol images
 - Use TailwindCSS for styles (tried to use it but didn't work, be my guess to try to implement it and make a pull request)
 - Might consider it turning this app into a full guide for each zombies map.
